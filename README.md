# Higher or Lower Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Higher or Lower" game, where players guess which of two randomly selected accounts has more followers.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players are presented with two options and must guess which has a higher follower count.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, incrementing with each correct guess.
- **Data Variety**: Includes a diverse set of accounts for comparison, enhancing replayability.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/masood2004/Higher_Or_Lower_Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Higher_Or_Lower_Project
   ```

3. **Ensure Python is installed**:

   This game requires Python 3.x. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

Run the `main.py` file to start the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Upon running the game, you'll see two accounts labeled 'A' and 'B', each with a description.
2. **Make a Guess**: Type 'A' or 'B' to guess which account has more followers.
3. **Feedback**: The game will inform you if your guess is correct and update your score accordingly.
4. **Continue**: The game continues with new comparisons until an incorrect guess is made.
5. **Game Over**: When you guess incorrectly, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.
